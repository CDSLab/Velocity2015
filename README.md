Presentation and Demo @ Velocity 2015 conference in Santa Clara CA
## Topic: Know before your customer knows: Monitoring trends to predict failures in the cloud
http://velocityconf.com/devops-web-performance-2015/public/schedule/detail/43537

The cloud is all about elasticity, so your monitoring solution should also be flexible enough to grow and shrink with service elasticity. In addition, with the growing popularity of the hybrid cloud, you need to monitor private and public resources regardless of their physical locations. A robust monitoring infrastructure doesnâ€™t just rely on reactive alerts and events, but learns the behavior of abstracted resources and business KPIs, and predicts the failures. Learn how you can use Event Hub, dashDB, and Cloudant to enable a self-service operation and make your cloud services resilient.
